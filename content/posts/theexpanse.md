The Expanse is an amazing Science Fiction series.

## Characters

Every character feels like a real human because with all its qualities and flaws.
They don't even stay the same but develop.
Even the characters that are supposed to be evil seem human by having their reasons exposed.

## Story

The story uses the setting well.
Science fiction has the advantage that it can talk about issues that are hard to talk about in a realistic setting.
Maybe this is why some stories are not appreciated in their time but after it.
In the hindsight the setting is distant enough so problems can be looked at more objectively.
