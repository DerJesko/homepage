My newest coding idea is to test my knowledge about AI creation and build an AI for a auto chess like game.
This seems like the correct amount of challenge since it round based making it easier to work with than most real time video games but still a bit harder than chess because it involves variables and randomness.
My intent is to build an AI based on the principles of Alpha Zero which is quite a high goal however one cannot learn without a challenge.

# Finding a Game
The first step would obviously need to be to find a game which I can interact with quite easily.
The current popular games are:

 - DotA 2 Auto Chess (a fanmade mod for Dota2)
 - DotA Underworlds (a auto battler by Valve)
 - Teamfight Tactics (a auto battler by Riot Games)

Which auto battler I choose to work on will highly depend on the ease of use of apis and such since I do not intent to read pixels from the screen, simulate mouse clicks and such things. Maybe I should also state that I do not intent to use my bot in an official multiplayer. The "official" in the previous sentence means that I want people who want to use it as practice or fun to be able to use it but not against players how did not consent to playing against it.
It is not clear to me which of the auto battlers I would prefer because on one hand I have a history with League of Legends as a player and most of my friends will be playing TFT. It also seems to me that TFT will be the most popular one of the three which might be due the recency of release, my friends and the media I consume. However from everything I see from Riot in esports I hope to never have to interact with them personally.
Not sure why I wrote this paragraph because they do not seem to be open to such things.
Valve on the other hand even has a wiki and forum for bots in DotA and most of their (older) games (artifact not) have some kind of mod or level editor support.

This is why I already contacted their support a few ours ago and not yet gotten a response (this sentence wasn't supposed to sound like I already expect an answer).
From my current state of research it might be possible to modify the autochess mod and their apis using the Dota workshop tools. I will be looking into this further but the current hurdle is that it only runs on windows which I do not have installed on any of my machines. We'll see
